The underestimation observed in the backtesting period, especially in Q2 2018, while notable, remains within the expected historical variability seen during the development phase. The champion model follows the real data closely, reflecting its robustness compared to the challenger, which showed far more significant out-of-time deviations. Despite a temporary bias in underestimation, the model's performance remains stable, and once in production, it transitioned to overestimation, proving its capacity to adjust to real-world conditions, including periods of both under- and overestimation. The model continues to capture the general trend of the default rate accurately, even under atypical conditions like the COVID-19 crisis.
