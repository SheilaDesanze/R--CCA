In response to the observation that previous analyses did not assess the impact on the final PiT PD given a defined threshold, we conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis based on 2023 values. This analysis involved applying a one standard deviation variation both upwards and downwards to all macroeconomic variables simultaneously, following the sign of each variable in the model (positive or negative).

The impact on the Point-in-Time Probability of Default (PiT PD) was measured for each segment as follows:

Primary Segment: The PiT PD fluctuated between 0.99% and 1.11%, with a midpoint ("K") of 1.05%.
Secondary Segment: The PiT PD ranged from 0.97% to 1.03%, with a midpoint ("K") of 1.00%.
Tertiary Segment: The PiT PD varied between 1.81% and 2.30%, with a midpoint ("K") of 2.06%.
These results demonstrate that the model is sensitive to the combined variation in macroeconomic factors, while maintaining stability within a reasonable range for each segment. The application of these deviations helps to evaluate the potential risk exposure under different economic conditions, and ensures that the model aligns with the expectations for robustness and accuracy.

Visual Analysis of Probability of Default (PD) by Segment
The horizontal bar chart provides a visual representation of the Probability of Default (PD) ranges for the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary segments. The horizontal axis displays the PD percentage, while the vertical axis identifies the three analyzed segments.

For each segment, the following characteristics are presented:

Primary Segment: The PD varies between 0.99% and 1.11%, with a midpoint ("K") located at 1.05%. This range indicates a moderate sensitivity to changes in macroeconomic variables.

Secondary Segment: The PD oscillates between 0.97% and 1.03%, with a midpoint ("K") of 1.00%. This segment shows less variability compared to the Primary segment, suggesting a stability in associated risk.

Tertiary Segment: The PD exhibits a broader range, from 1.81% to 2.30%, with a midpoint ("K") of 2.06%. This reflects a higher risk and variability, indicating greater sensitivity to economic changes.

The graph clearly illustrates how PD values are distributed around their midpoints, highlighting the variation caused by applying standard deviations to macroeconomic variables. The representation of minimum and maximum values allows for the identification of risk amplitude in each segment, facilitating a deeper understanding of default exposure under different economic contexts.
